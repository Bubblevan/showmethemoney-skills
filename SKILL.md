# ShowMeTheMoney Skill

This skill is the demo buyer-side target for the StablePay A2 flow.

## What this skill assumes

- OpenClaw has the `stablepay-openclaw-plugin` installed and enabled
- the plugin has a local wallet runtime available
- the StablePay backend is reachable through `api-gateway`
- payment execution is still backed by the existing StablePay HTTP 402 and `/api/v1/pay` flow

## Recommended preparation

Before using the paid capability, the agent should make sure the user-side wallet and policy prep are complete:

1. Call `stablepay_runtime_status`
2. If no wallet exists, call `stablepay_create_local_wallet`
3. Call `stablepay_register_local_did`
4. Call `stablepay_configure_payment_limits`
5. Call `stablepay_build_payment_policy`

## Paid access behavior

1. Attempt the paid skill request.
2. If the backend returns HTTP `402 Payment Required`, explain that payment is required.
3. Ask the StablePay plugin to complete payment in-chat (`stablepay_pay_via_gateway` or `stablepay_execute_paid_skill_demo`).
4. Only continue after the StablePay backend confirms the purchase.
5. If verification fails or payment is incomplete, do not continue.

## Current scope

This demo is intentionally limited:

- real X verification is still out of scope
- real on-chain Solana transfer is enabled through the StablePay plugin payment flow
- OWS policy registration is represented today by a local OWS-ready policy manifest because the current Windows environment does not support the official OWS Node SDK directly

## Safety

- Never expose private keys or decrypted local state
- Never claim purchase success unless the backend confirms it
- Treat local payment limits as user protection, not as a replacement for backend validation
